== NES DEVELOPMENT - Avik Das ==========================================

A collection of programs written for the Nintendo Entertainment System
(NES). Due to the limitations of the hardware, all the programs must be
relatively small, so it makes sense to keep them all in the same
repository.

The included programs are described briefly below, while more elaborate
descriptions are provided inside the corresponding directories.

~~ PREREQUISITES ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The programs are written in 6502 assembly, using the Ophis Assembler,
which may be found at https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~mcmartin/ophis/ .
The Makefiles assume that the assembler is on the PATH.

To run the programs after assembly, an NES emulator is required. The
programs are tested on FCEUX, which is available at
http://fceux.com/web/home.html .

~~ INCLUDED PROGRAMS ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

More detailed descriptions are available in the README files inside the
directory containing each program.

sprite - A simple test program that demonstrates a wide variety of
  hardware-provided functionality and general programming techniques.

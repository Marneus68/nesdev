== NES DEVELOPMENT - Avik Das ==========================================

The Github pages corresponding to the NES development project by Avik
Das: https://github.com/avik-das/nesdev

There is a landing page for the entire project, as well as landing pages
for each of the sub-projects within this project. In each case, the page
is laid out like an NES cartridge, using the resources under the common/
directory. The pages are then customized further, altering properties
such as the background color and the header.
